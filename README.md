This is a project to demonstrate a usage of Naive Bayes which a classifier algorithm

In this project we gonna know the email authors by analyzing the predefined email data sets (email_authors , word_data)

NOTE : -> To run this project you should have >= python 3 
    
       -> We will use pip to install some packages. First get and install pip from https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/. Using pip, install a bunch of python packages:

              go to your terminal line (donâ€™t open python, just the command prompt)
              install sklearn: pip install scikit-learn
                   -- for your reference, the link sklearn installation instructions https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
              install natural language toolkit: pip install nltk
              You will need git to clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git

       -> Keep the files (email_authors , word_data , startup , email_preprocess) in a seperate folder (name it as tools) after cloning the repo..

       -> Go into the tools/ directory, and run startup.py. It will first check for the python modules, then download and unzip a large dataset that we will use heavily later , this will take a couple of minutes

       -> And the final step , run the nb_author_id.py file
